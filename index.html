            <h1>Who We Are and Why We Are...</h1>
            <p>We are a young group of starters who dream of a future where all homes function independently and where a zombie apocalypse would really, not be so bad. Instead of waiting for this change to come we decided to begin ourselves. Energy has become a necessity in all our homes so we have embarked ourselves on the great journey of harnessing energy from the sun.</p>

                    <p>We are nowhere near as good as plants when it comes to using the sun effectively but we do have some tricks up our sleeves.  The photovoltaic effect is an old concept; it was discovered by Edmund Becquerel, a French physicist, in 1839. Since then, the technology has advanced greatly but it was always too expensive and inefficient to be used on a wide-scale.</p>
                    <p>In the recent years though, the efficiency and affordability of our cells has increased dramatically. We are entering a time when an average home owner can have a solar array that powers their entire home without breaking the bank.

                <p><img src="images/rasolar_step1.png"/><span class="bold"></span>Step 1:</span> Sing up with us or give us a call to guide you through the process. Here we will get all the necessary information and set up a date for your homeâ€™s assessment.</p>
                <p><img src="images/rasolar_step1.png"/>Step 2: Visual assessment. We will visit your home to check the roof for orientation and structural stability, we will also asses what kind of solar radiation is expected in the area and make sure there are no obstructions to the sun rays on your home.</p>
                <p><img src="images/rasolar_step1.png"/>Step 3: If your household is eligible, we will show you our solar array design for your home and, with your approval, move on to the technical and permit stages.</p>
                <p><img src="images/rasolar_step1.png"/>Step 4: We will take care of all permits required (BC Hydro & City Permits) and all electrical/structural design. </p>
                <p><img src="images/rasolar_step1.png"/>Step 5: Once the design phase is complete and all permits are in place, we will setup a date and follow through with the installation.</p>

                <p>-The original assessment is on us.</p>

                <p>-We will come up with a total price for your system based on cost of materials and man-hours spent on it.</p>

                <p>-After the installation is complete, a monthly fee will begin. This fee will be based on how much energy your system produces.</p>

                <p>-Our ultimate goal is to have the home owner literally own the system, so as soon as the energy fees amount to a value equal to the initial system price the fees will stop. (We believe this business structure benefits all parties involved; we get a return on investment based on the performance of our system and the home owner gets virtually free energy after the system is paid for)</p>

                <p>-System maintenance is equated in the original price so there are no extra fees attached to it.</p>
